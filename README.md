**Puppy Pals**

This is Ruby on Rails app I created with a team in four days at the Le Wagon coding Bootcamp. It is an AirBnB clone that allows users to rent out puppies for a day.

* Ruby 2.5.3

* You may need to run yarn install and bundle install

* This project uses a postgreSQL database, run `rails db:create` to create the database

* Database initialization - run `rails db:migrate`

Current User Stories:

* As a visitor, I can search for puppies in my area available on a certain date

* As a visitor, I can view all available puppies in my area

* As a visitor, I can view the details about a puppy

* As a renter, I can book a playdate with a puppy

* As a renter, I can cancel a playdate with a puppy

* As a renter, I can review a playdate puppy

* As an owner, I can create a profile for my puppy

* As an owner, I can edit my puppy's profile

* As an owner, I can delete my puppy's profile

* As an owner, I can view all my puppies

* As an owner, I can view all booking requests for my puppy

* As an owner, I can accept or decline a booking request for my puppy

I would like to add the following:

* Stripe Integration
